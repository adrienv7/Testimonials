            I received a job offer mid-course, and the sujects I learned were
            current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
            got every penny's worth.

            "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been
            looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
            amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
            found it incredibly fun! I enrrolled shortly thereafter. The nest 12
            weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
            completing the course, I've successffully switched careers, working
            as a Software Enginner at a VR startup."

            Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
            Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
            easy.

            "The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find
            really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to
            be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
            junior developer.The standard is above the rest. You will get the
            personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart
            and amazing people."

            "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
            needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
            programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
            program. The entire curriculum and staff did not dissapoint. They
            were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
            agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
            learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
            have. In fact, I've often refered to it during interviews as an
            example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a
            job a a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
            recommend!"
